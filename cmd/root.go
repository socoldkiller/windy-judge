	Short: "Automated Test Judge Tool with Multi-format Case Parsing and Smart Diff Analysis",
	Long: `A Go-based automated test judging system with core features:

- Supports multiple test case formats: JSON/YAML/Text/HTTP
- Intelligent diff analysis algorithm for precise result comparison
- Generates detailed reports in HTML/Markdown formats
- CI/CD integration with exit code based result reporting
- Extensible plugin architecture for custom parsers and reporters

Typical use cases:
  1. Automated test framework result validation
  2. Programming problem scoring system
  3. Data comparison and consistency checks
  4. CI/CD quality gates`,
